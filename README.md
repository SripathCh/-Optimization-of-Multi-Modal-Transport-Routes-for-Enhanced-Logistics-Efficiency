# Optimization of Multi-Modal Transport Routes for Enhanced Logistics Efficiency

The Multi-Mode Transport/Logistics Optimizer is designed to provide advanced route planning solutions that minimize costs, reduce environmental impact, and enhance delivery efficiency across multiple transportation modes. This project utilizes a sophisticated mathematical framework to dynamically select the optimal routes for logistics operations, focusing on balancing cost, time, and carbon emissions.

## Features

Dynamic Route Optimization: Calculates the most efficient routes considering various factors such as cost, time, emissions, and transport mode capacities.

Premium and Standard Service Handling: Tailors routing solutions to accommodate different service level requirements, ensuring faster delivery times for premium services.

Environmental Consideration: Prioritizes routes and modes of transport that minimize carbon emissions.

Decision Support: Integrates with Decision Guidance Analytical Language (DGAL) for enhanced decision-making capabilities.

## Technologies

Python: Primary programming language used for building the analytical model.

JSON: Used for input and output data format, making it simple for users to integrate with existing systems.

DGAL: Utilized for optimization processes within the model.
